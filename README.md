## Project Description

**Catch The Insect** is a fun and fast-paced browser game where players test their reflexes by catching insects that appear randomly on the screen. The game starts easy, but as your score increases, more insects appear, making it progressively more challenging.

Players can select from a variety of insects such as flies, mosquitoes, spiders, and roaches before beginning the game. The objective is to catch as many insects as possible by clicking on them before they escape. As your score increases, the game introduces additional insects to keep things exciting. 

A timer tracks how long you can stay in the game, and a scoreboard keeps a running total of your score. Once your score surpasses 19, the game displays a fun message to keep you motivated!

**Key Features**:
- Choose from different insects to catch (Fly, Mosquito, Spider, Roach).
- Random insect appearance and movement across the screen.
- Real-time score tracking and timer.
- Retro-style design with smooth animations and a challenge that gets harder the longer you play.

**Technologies Used**:
- HTML for the structure of the game.
- CSS for styling and layout.
- JavaScript for the gameâ€™s logic and interactivity.

Try to keep up as the insects swarm faster and faster!
